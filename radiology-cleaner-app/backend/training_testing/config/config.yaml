# UNIFIED SCORING & PREPROCESSING CONFIGURATION (V3.1 - AUGMENTED)
# ====================================================================================
# This file centralizes all business logic, weights, rules, and abbreviations for the
# radiology exam standardization engine. It is the "brain" of the application.
#
# HOW TO USE:
# - Adjust weights to change the importance of different matching components.
# - Add new abbreviations to the 'preprocessing' section to handle new exam names.
# - Define new rules and constraints to enforce clinical safety and logic.
# - Comments explain the purpose and impact of each section.
# ====================================================================================

scoring:
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # RETRIEVER & CORE SCORING WEIGHTS
  # Controls the behavior of the main matching algorithm.
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # Number of initial candidates to retrieve from the fast vector search (FAISS).
  # A larger number might find a better match but increases processing time for the scoring stage.
  retriever_top_k: 30

  # --- COMPONENT WEIGHTS ---
  # These weights determine the importance of each structured part of the exam name when
  # calculating the 'component_score'. The total should ideally be 1.0.
  weights_component:
    anatomy: 0.25      # Importance of matching anatomy (e.g., 'head', 'chest').
    modality: 0.35     # Importance of matching modality (e.g., 'CT', 'MRI'). Highest weight as it's critical.
    laterality: 0.10   # Importance of matching laterality (e.g., 'left', 'right').
    contrast: 0.20     # Increased importance of matching contrast status (e.g., 'with contrast').
    technique: 0.10    # Importance of matching specific techniques (e.g., 'MRCP', 'SPECT').

  # --- FINAL SCORE WEIGHTS ---
  # V3 Architecture: These weights combine the 'component_score' (rules-based), 'reranker_score' (cross-encoder),
  # and 'complexity_score' (appropriateness matching) to produce the final confidence score.
  weights_final:
    component: 0.35    # How much to trust the structured component match (rules-based).
    reranker: 0.50     # How much to trust the MedCPT cross-encoder reranking score.
    complexity: 0.15   # How much to trust complexity appropriateness (simple inputs prefer simple FSNs).
    # frequency: 0.10  # This appears to be a planned or deprecated feature for popularity-based scoring.

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # BONUSES & PENALTIES
  # Fine-tunes the final score based on specific contextual clues and match quality.
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  interventional_bonus: 0.15        # Small bonus if both input and candidate are interventional.
  interventional_penalty: -0.20     # Penalty if input is interventional but the candidate is not.
  exact_match_bonus: 0.25           # Bonus if the cleaned input string is an exact match to the candidate name.
  synonym_match_bonus: 0.15         # Bonus if a match is found via an abbreviation (e.g., input 'LSP' matches 'lumbar spine').
  context_match_bonus: 0.10         # General bonus for matching clinical contexts (e.g., both are 'emergency').
  modality_similarity_threshold: 0.8 # A threshold that is likely used elsewhere to gate partial modality credit.

  # --- ANATOMICAL SPECIFICITY SCORING ---
  # A more nuanced approach than a simple penalty. It rewards useful detail and penalizes noise.
  anatomical_specificity_bonus: 0.10    # Bonus for clinically relevant extra words in the candidate (e.g., 'artery').
  general_specificity_penalty: 0.20     # Penalty for irrelevant extra words (e.g., 'procedure', 'examination').
  technique_specificity_bonus: 0.05     # Small bonus for extra words indicating a more specific technique.

  # --- CONTRAST SCORING ---
  # Contrast is clinically critical, so mismatches are penalized heavily.
  contrast_mismatch_score: 0.05     # SEVERE penalty if input is 'with' and candidate is 'without' (or vice-versa).
  contrast_null_score: 0.7          # Score when one has contrast info and the other does not (an ambiguous case).
  prefer_no_contrast_when_unspecified: true  # If true, an input without contrast info will prefer a non-contrast candidate.
  no_contrast_preference_bonus: 0.25         # The bonus applied if the above condition is met.

  # --- AGE/GENDER CONTEXT BONUSES ---
  gender_context_match_bonus: 0.20  # For matching 'female'/'male' contexts (e.g., prostate, breast).
