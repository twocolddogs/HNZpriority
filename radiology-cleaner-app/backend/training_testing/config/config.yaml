# UNIFIED SCORING & PREPROCESSING CONFIGURATION (V3.3 - ENHANCED SAFETY)
# ====================================================================================
# This file centralizes all business logic, weights, rules, and abbreviations for the
# radiology exam standardization engine. It is the "brain" of the application.
#
# HOW TO USE:
# - Adjust weights to change the importance of different matching components.
# - Add new abbreviations to the 'preprocessing' section to handle new exam names.
# - Define new rules and constraints to enforce clinical safety and logic.
# - Comments explain the purpose and impact of each section.

  # RETRIEVER & CORE SCORING WEIGHTS
  # Controls the behavior of the main matching algorithm.
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # Number of initial candidates to retrieve from the fast vector search (FAISS).
  # A larger number might find a better match but increases processing time for the scoring stage.
  retriever_top_k: 15

  # --- COMPONENT WEIGHTS ---
  # These weights determine the importance of each structured part of the exam name when
  # calculating the 'component_score'. The total should ideally be 1.0.
  weights_component:
    anatomy: 0.25      # Importance of matching anatomy (e.g., 'head', 'chest').
    modality: 0.35     # Importance of matching modality (e.g., 'CT', 'MRI'). Highest weight as it's critical.
    laterality: 0.10   # Importance of matching laterality (e.g., 'left', 'right').
    contrast: 0.20     # Increased importance of matching contrast status (e.g., 'with contrast').
    technique: 0.10    # Importance of matching specific techniques (e.g., 'MRCP', 'SPECT').

  # --- FINAL SCORE WEIGHTS ---
  # V3 Architecture: These weights combine the 'component_score' (rules-based), 'reranker_score' (cross-encoder),
  # and 'complexity_score' (appropriateness matching) to produce the final confidence score.
  weights_final:
    component: 0.65    # How much to trust the structured component match (rules-based). Increased to counteract reranker dominance.
    reranker: 0.35     # How much to trust the MedCPT cross-encoder reranking score. Reduced to give component scoring more influence.
    # complexity: 0.15   # How much to trust complexity appropriateness (simple inputs prefer simple FSNs).
    # frequency: 0.10  # This appears to be a planned or deprecated feature for popularity-based scoring.
    
    # Reranker-specific weights (optimal tuning per model type)
    reranker_specific:
      # NLP Models - Need more component scoring help due to limited clinical reasoning
      medcpt:
        component: 0.65   
        reranker: 0.35
      biolord:
        component: 0.60   # Slightly more trust in BioLORD than MedCPT
        reranker: 0.40
      default:  # BioLORD fallback
        component: 0.60
        reranker: 0.40

      # OpenRouter Models - Trust their advanced medical reasoning more
      gpt-4o-mini:
        component: 0.45   # Let GPTs medical logic shine
        reranker: 0.55
      claude-3-haiku:
        component: 0.50   # Balanced approach for Claude
        reranker: 0.50

  # BONUSES & PENALTIES
  # Fine-tunes the final score based on specific contextual clues and match quality.
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  interventional_bonus: 0.15        # Small bonus if both input and candidate are interventional.
  interventional_penalty: -0.20     # Penalty if input is interventional but the candidate is not.

  synonym_match_bonus: 0.15         # Bonus if a match is found via an abbreviation (e.g., input 'LSP' matches 'lumbar spine').
  context_match_bonus: 0.10         # General bonus for matching clinical contexts (e.g., both are 'emergency').
  modality_similarity_threshold: 0.8 # A threshold that is likely used elsewhere to gate partial modality credit.

  # --- ANATOMICAL SPECIFICITY SCORING ---
  # A more nuanced approach than a simple penalty. It rewards useful detail and penalizes noise.
  anatomical_specificity_bonus: 0.10    # Bonus for clinically relevant extra words in the candidate (e.g., 'artery').
  general_specificity_penalty: 0.20     # Penalty for irrelevant extra words (e.g., 'procedure', 'examination').
  technique_specificity_bonus: 0.05     # Small bonus for extra words indicating a more specific technique.

  # --- CONTRAST SCORING ---
  # Contrast is clinically critical, so mismatches are penalized heavily.
  contrast_mismatch_score: 0.05     # SEVERE penalty if input is 'with' and candidate is 'without' (or vice-versa).
  contrast_null_score: 0.7          # Score when one has contrast info and the other does not (an ambiguous case).
  prefer_no_contrast_when_unspecified: true  # If true, an input without contrast info will prefer a non-contrast candidate.
  no_contrast_preference_bonus: 0.25         # The bonus applied if the above condition is met.

    You are a meticulous radiology data standardization expert. Your task is to map an `input_exam` to the most appropriate candidate from a given list by calling the `select_best_match` tool.

    **GUIDING PRINCIPLE: The Principle of Parsimony**
    The correct match is the one that includes all specified components from the `input_exam` (modality, anatomy, contrast, etc.) while introducing the **absolute minimum** of new, unspecified information. Do not "upgrade" the exam to a more complex version.

    **Evaluation Steps:**
    1.  **Decompose Input:** Identify the essential components of the `input_exam`. A modality mismatch (e.g., input is 'US' but all candidates are 'MG') is a critical failure.
    2.  **Evaluate Candidates:** For each candidate, compare the `input_exam` against both its `primary_name` and its `snomed_fsn`. The FSN is the ultimate source of truth. Ignore the `(procedure)` suffix in the FSN.
    3.  **Select Best Match:** Choose the candidate whose `snomed_fsn` best represents the procedure described in the `input_exam` without adding unsubstantiated details.
    4.  **Handle No Match:** If no candidate is a suitable match, you MUST provide `null` for the `best_match_snomed_id` and `best_match_procedure_name` arguments in your tool call.

    **EXPLICIT NO-MATCH CRITERIA - Automatically reject candidates if:**
    - **Modality mismatch:** Input specifies 'CT' but candidate is 'MRI' or vice versa
    - **Contrast mismatch:** Input specifies 'with contrast' but candidate is 'without contrast' or vice versa  
    - **Hybrid modality mismatch:** Input is 'PET/CT' but candidate is 'PET/MRI' or vice versa
    - **Diagnostic vs Interventional mismatch:** Input is simple diagnostic but candidate is interventional (biopsy, drainage, etc.)
    - **Anatomical incompatibility:** Input anatomy cannot physically match candidate anatomy (e.g., 'breast' vs 'prostate')
    - **Vessel type mismatch:** Input specifies arterial imaging but candidate is venous or vice versa

    **TIE-BREAKER HIERARCHY (when multiple candidates are equally valid):**
    1. **SNOMED FSN Authority:** Prefer candidate whose FSN most precisely matches input without excess detail
    2. **Parsimony Principle:** Choose simpler procedure over complex one (fewer qualifiers, techniques, or specifications)
    3. **Modality Exactness:** Prefer exact modality match over partial/similar modality
    4. **Contrast Clarity:** Prefer explicit contrast specification over ambiguous contrast status
    5. **Anatomical Precision:** Prefer specific anatomy match over general anatomy when input is specific

    **QUALITY CHECKS:**
    - Verify the selected candidate actually addresses the clinical question implied by the input
    - Ensure no critical clinical information from input is lost in the mapping
    - Confirm the match represents the same level of clinical complexity as the input
