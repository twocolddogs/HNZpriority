# Goal: Radiology Code Semantic Cleaner

## Primary Objective

The Radiology Code Semantic Cleaner aims to **standardize disparate radiology examination names into consistent, clinically meaningful clean names with associated SNOMED codes**, enabling better data quality and interoperability across healthcare systems.

## Core Mission

**Transform inconsistent radiology exam naming into standardized medical terminology** by leveraging artificial intelligence to parse, understand, and map examination names to internationally recognized SNOMED CT codes.

## Key Goals

### 1. Medical Terminology Standardization
- Convert varied radiology exam names into consistent, standardized clean names
- Map examination names to appropriate SNOMED CT concept IDs and Fully Specified Names (FSN)
- Ensure clinical accuracy and medical relevance in all mappings

### 2. Data Quality Improvement
- Eliminate naming inconsistencies across different healthcare systems and providers
- Reduce manual effort required for radiology data cleaning and standardization
- Enable better data analytics and reporting through consistent terminology

### 3. Intelligent Processing
- Use hybrid AI approach combining Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and rule-based logic
- Achieve high accuracy through multi-stage parsing and fuzzy matching algorithms
- Provide confidence scoring to indicate mapping reliability

### 4. Clinical Context Understanding
- Extract and preserve important clinical components (anatomy, laterality, contrast, technique)
- Apply cranial-to-caudal anatomical ordering for consistent presentation
- Handle clinical equivalences (e.g., CT Abdomen ≈ CT Abdomen and Pelvis)

### 5. Healthcare Interoperability
- Support SNOMED CT international standard for medical terminology
- Enable seamless data exchange between healthcare systems
- Facilitate compliance with medical coding standards and requirements

## Target Outcomes

### For Healthcare Systems
- **Improved Data Quality**: Consistent radiology exam terminology across all systems
- **Enhanced Interoperability**: Standardized codes enable better system integration
- **Reduced Manual Work**: Automated cleaning eliminates tedious manual standardization

### For Clinical Teams
- **Better Analytics**: Standardized data enables meaningful reporting and analysis
- **Improved Workflow**: Consistent naming reduces confusion and errors
- **Enhanced Communication**: Common terminology improves clinical communication

### For Healthcare Organizations
- **Compliance Support**: Meet medical coding standards and regulatory requirements
- **Cost Reduction**: Eliminate manual data cleaning overhead
- **Quality Improvement**: Better data enables better clinical decision support

## Technical Approach

### Multi-Stage Processing Pipeline
1. **Input Processing**: Handle JSON data with exam names and modality codes
2. **Abbreviation Expansion**: Convert abbreviations to full medical terms
3. **Component Extraction**: Use NLP, ML, and rules to identify anatomy, laterality, contrast, etc.
4. **Clean Name Generation**: Create standardized exam names with proper anatomical ordering
5. **SNOMED Mapping**: Match to appropriate SNOMED CT codes with confidence scoring
6. **Quality Assessment**: Provide metrics and suggestions for result validation

### Hybrid AI Architecture
- **ScispaCy NLP**: Medical domain language processing for entity recognition
- **Machine Learning**: Multi-output classification trained on 4,986 SNOMED entries
- **Rule-Based Engine**: Clinical patterns and medical terminology rules
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Multi-metric similarity scoring for optimal SNOMED code assignment

## Success Measures

The application succeeds when it:
- Achieves 85-90% accuracy in anatomical detection
- Maintains 95%+ accuracy in contrast agent detection
- Provides 60-70% high-quality fuzzy matches (confidence > 0.7)
- Processes exams at ~1,000 exams/minute throughput
- Reduces manual radiology data cleaning effort by 80%+

## Real-World Impact

### Data Integration
Transform inconsistent exam names like:
- "CT chest abd" → "CT Chest abdomen and pelvis" (SNOMED: 418023006)
- "MRI brain w/o contrast" → "MRI Head without contrast" (SNOMED: 241615005)
- "XR left shoulder" → "XR Shoulder Left" (SNOMED: 169069000)

### Quality Assurance
- Provide confidence scores to indicate mapping reliability
- Flag uncertain mappings for human review
- Track performance metrics and user feedback for continuous improvement

### Healthcare System Integration
- Support RESTful API for easy integration
- Provide FHIR-compatible output formats
- Enable batch processing for large datasets

## Long-term Vision
