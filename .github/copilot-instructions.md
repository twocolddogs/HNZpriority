# HNZ Priority Healthcare Applications

This repository contains multiple healthcare applications for New Zealand's Health system, including radiology triage tools, clinical decision support systems, and data processing pipelines. The applications serve healthcare professionals across New Zealand and are production-critical systems.

**Always reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Do not open PRs to main. Always target develop.**

## Working Effectively

### Core Requirements
- Use `python3` (NOT `python`) for all Python commands - Python 2 compatibility is not available
- Always work on the `develop` branch - NEVER make changes directly to `main` branch
- All static applications run without build processes using Python HTTP servers
- Network connectivity issues prevent pip package installation in some environments

### Quick Start - Static Applications (ALWAYS WORK)
```bash
# HNZ Radiology Triage Tool (Root Directory)
cd /path/to/repository
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Access: http://localhost:8000 - starts in ~2 seconds

# Decision Support Tool  
cd /path/to/repository/decision-support
python3 -m http.server 8001
# Access: http://localhost:8001 - starts in ~2 seconds

# LORA Configurator
cd /path/to/repository/lora  
python3 -m http.server 8002
# Access: http://localhost:8002/configurator.html - starts in ~2 seconds
```

### Radiology Cleaner App (Complex Dependencies)
```bash
# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT (requires network connectivity)
cd /path/to/repository/radiology-cleaner-app
./dev-setup.sh
# This script:
# 1. Creates Python virtual environment
# 2. Installs dependencies (FAILS in restricted networks)
# 3. Starts backend on localhost:10000
# 4. Starts frontend on localhost:8000

# MANUAL DEPENDENCY INSTALL (often fails due to network timeouts)
cd radiology-cleaner-app/backend
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user
# WARNING: This typically FAILS after 15-25 seconds due to network timeouts
# Network issues prevent access to PyPI in some environments

# FALLBACK: Check available dependencies
python3 -c "import requests; print('requests OK')"  # Usually works
python3 -c "import flask; print('flask OK')"        # Usually fails
python3 -c "import numpy; print('numpy OK')"        # Usually fails
```

## Repository Structure

### 1. HNZ Radiology Triage Tool (Root Directory)

## Build and Test Procedures

### Static Applications - ALWAYS WORK
```bash
# Test all static applications (takes ~6 seconds total)
cd /path/to/repository

# Clean up any existing servers first
pkill -f "python3.*http.server" 2>/dev/null || true
sleep 2

# Test 1: Main Radiology Triage Tool
timeout 10 python3 -m http.server 8000 &
MAIN_PID=$!
sleep 2
curl -I http://localhost:8000/ | grep "200 OK"  # Should succeed
kill $MAIN_PID 2>/dev/null

# Test 2: Decision Support Tool  
cd decision-support
timeout 10 python3 -m http.server 8001 &
DS_PID=$!
sleep 2
curl -I http://localhost:8001/ | grep "200 OK"  # Should succeed
kill $DS_PID 2>/dev/null
cd ..

# Test 3: LORA Configurator
cd lora
timeout 10 python3 -m http.server 8002 &
LORA_PID=$!
sleep 2  
curl -I http://localhost:8002/configurator.html | grep "200 OK"  # Should succeed
kill $LORA_PID 2>/dev/null
cd ..
```

### Radiology Cleaner Backend - NETWORK DEPENDENT
```bash
# NEVER CANCEL: Dependency installation takes 2-5 minutes when it works
# In restricted networks, this FAILS after 15-25 seconds with timeout errors
cd radiology-cleaner-app/backend
timeout 300 pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user 2>&1
# Expected outcome in restricted networks: "TimeoutError: The read operation timed out"
# Expected outcome with network access: Successful installation in 2-5 minutes

# NEVER CANCEL: Backend startup takes 30-60 seconds when dependencies are available
# Set timeout to 120+ seconds for backend initialization
timeout 120 python3 app.py &
sleep 30  # Allow initialization time
curl -s http://localhost:10000/health || echo "Backend not ready or dependencies missing"
```

## Validation Scenarios

### ALWAYS validate static applications after changes:
1. **HNZ Radiology Triage Tool**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/repository
   python3 -m http.server 8000 &
   sleep 2
   # Validate: Access http://localhost:8000, verify page loads with triage scenarios
   # Check: Scenarios display correctly, search functionality works
   # Check: Editor/view mode switching (requires specific hostname in production)
   kill %1
   ```

2. **Decision Support Tool**:
   ```bash
   cd decision-support
   python3 -m http.server 8001 &
   sleep 2
   # Validate: Access http://localhost:8001, verify clinical pathways load
   # Check: Pathway navigation works, JSON data loads correctly
   kill %1
   ```

3. **LORA Configurator**:
   ```bash
   cd lora
   python3 -m http.server 8002 &
   sleep 2
   # Validate: Access http://localhost:8002/configurator.html
   # Check: CSV import/export functionality, data editing interface
   kill %1
   ```

### Radiology Cleaner Validation (when dependencies available):
```bash
cd radiology-cleaner-app/backend
# NEVER CANCEL: Full startup can take 60+ seconds, set timeout to 120+ seconds
timeout 120 python3 app.py &
sleep 30

# Test health endpoint
curl -s http://localhost:10000/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy", "message": "API is running"}

# Test model availability  
curl -s http://localhost:10000/models
# Expected: JSON with available NLP models

# Test parsing endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:10000/parse_enhanced \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"exam_name": "CT CHEST"}'
# Expected: JSON response with standardized exam data
```

## Deployment Commands

### Production Deployment - Radiology Cleaner (Render.com)
```bash
# Trigger production deployment to Render.com
curl -X POST "https://api.render.com/deploy/srv-d1mss0ripnbc7398djh0?key=AY2l21TBDdU"
# This is the "buildit" command referenced in documentation
# NEVER CANCEL: Deployment takes 5-10 minutes on Render.com
```

### Cloudflare Workers Deployment
```bash
# Decision Support API (requires wrangler CLI)
cd decision-support
# Note: wrangler deployment not available in all environments
# Production deployment handled separately via Cloudflare dashboard
```

## Common Issues and Limitations

### Network Connectivity Issues
- **pip install FAILS**: PyPI access blocked, timeouts after 15-25 seconds
- **Workaround**: Use system packages or pre-installed dependencies
- **Production**: Render.com environment has full network access

### Python Environment
- **Always use `python3`**: Python 2 not available or reliable
- **Virtual environments**: Recommended for radiology-cleaner-app development
- **System packages**: requests available, flask/numpy typically not available

### Branch Management
- **CRITICAL**: Always work on `develop` branch
- **NEVER**: Make changes directly to `main` branch (production)
- **All feature work must branch from develop and open pull requests into develop (not main).**
- **Do not open PRs to main under any circumstances.**
- **Release PRs from develop to main are created and merged by maintainers only.**
- **Main is a protected, production branch and deploys to production automatically. Develop is the integration branch.**
- **Deployment**: main branch deploys to production automatically

## Time Expectations

### Commands That Work Quickly (< 10 seconds)
- Static HTTP server startup: ~2 seconds each
- Basic connectivity tests: ~2 seconds each  
- Repository navigation and file operations: immediate

### Commands That Take Time
- **pip install** (when network works): 2-5 minutes - NEVER CANCEL, set timeout to 300+ seconds
- **pip install** (network restricted): Fails in 15-25 seconds with timeout errors
- **Backend initialization**: 30-60 seconds - NEVER CANCEL, set timeout to 120+ seconds
- **Render.com deployment**: 5-10 minutes - NEVER CANCEL

### NEVER CANCEL Warnings
- **NEVER CANCEL** pip install commands - either they work (2-5 minutes) or fail quickly (15-25 seconds)
- **NEVER CANCEL** backend startup - initialization requires 30-60 seconds minimum
- **NEVER CANCEL** production deployments - Render.com takes 5-10 minutes for full deployment

## Critical Notes

### Healthcare Application Warning
This is a production healthcare system serving New Zealand's health professionals. Changes affect real clinical decision-making. Always:
- Test thoroughly in development
- Validate all functionality after changes
- Follow proper branch management (feature branches → develop via pull request; maintainer-only release PRs develop → main)
- Document any changes that affect clinical workflows

### File Locations for Common Tasks
- **JSON data**: `priority_data_set.json` (radiology triage), `decision-support/pathways/*.json` (clinical pathways)
- **CSS styles**: `styles.css` (main), `decision-support/app-styles.css`, `lora/styles.css`
- **Configuration**: `render.yaml` (deployment), `wrangler-api.toml` (Cloudflare)
- **Scripts**: `radiology-cleaner-app/dev-setup.sh` (development), `backend/build.sh` (production)
